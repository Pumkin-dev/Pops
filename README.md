# Pops
repository of my game about a red panda in a confused world
As said above, my game is in its debuts. So I should make some explanations on what to do or not with my project:
-You will not copy/steal my code or content like my sprites. This is my work and I cannot accept that ones use my content without my consent. You can ask me for taking code although. Otherwise, my sprites and others are not meant be taken.
-You may download the project to test it in GameMaker Studio 2. I am not a perfect programmer so there will be mistakes or non-optimized code. If you want to make me part of your advice, you can.
Story:
	Pops, a red panda, wakes up in an unknown place at the sound of a heavy noise. He will investigate but more importantly : will try to come back home.
I think that's all I have to say on my game for now. Thanks for reading!
